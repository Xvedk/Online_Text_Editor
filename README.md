# Online_Text_Editor

This HTML document creates a simple online text editor with additional features. It has a text input area where users can type, a word count display, and the ability to change the editor's theme. Here's a summary of its components:

1. **Text Editor**: The primary element is a text area (textarea) that users can type in. It's styled to cover most of the screen and has a placeholder to guide users.

2. **Word Count**: A JavaScript function called `view_count` counts the words in the text area and displays the count in a separate div. It also provides encouraging remarks when specific word count milestones are reached (e.g., 5,000 words, 10,000 words).

3. **Theme Changer**: Users can change the editor's theme by entering values for font color, background color, font family, and font size in input fields. Clicking the "Get New Theme" button applies the specified theme to the text editor.

The editor is minimalistic and designed for simplicity, with the option for users to personalize the visual style to their preference. It also provides motivation by recognizing achievements as users write.
